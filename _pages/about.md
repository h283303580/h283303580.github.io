Research Interests
======

Chengqian Huang's research focuses on the design, characterization, and application of polymer nanofilms based on Chemical Vapor deposition (CVD). He is devoted to manipulating the microstructures and special compositions of CVD films to achieve functional modifications of various membranes and medical devices for different environmental and biological applications such as wastewater treatment/purification, pharmaceutics drug delivery, and bioadhesion control.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
