**Chegqian Huang** received his Bachelor in **Chemical Engineering** from Southeast University at 2017 and he is now a Ph.D. candidate in **Biosystems Engineering** at Oklahoma State University. 

Chengqian is available for:

* peer review for journals and conferences
* collaborate to write review papers
* (co-)guest editor for a special issue of journals

Research Interests
------

Chengqian Huang's research focuses on the design, characterization, and application of **polymer nanofilms** based on Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). He is devoted to manipulating the microstructures and compositions of CVD polymer films to achieve functional modifications of various membranes and medical devices for different environmental and biological applications such as wastewater treatments/purifications, pharmaceutics drug delivery, and bioadhesion control.

Projects
------
**Oily wastewater treatment**

We are using the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method to modify the metal meshes with special wettability and using the modified mesh for the treatment of oily wastewater coming from the industry or oil spill accidents. When the wastewater passed the modified mesh, the clean water will be separated and the petroleum oil will be recovered fastly and efficiently.

Compared with the traditional liquid-based modification, the CVD method preserved the mesh openings after modification, which allows the water freely penetrated to ensure fast wastewater treatment. The specially designed modification layer provides strong surface resistance to oil contaminations and improves the oil recovery efficiency for the mesh.  

**Pharmaceutic drug delivery**

We are using Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) to encapsulate pharmaceutic drugs for controlled release from three-dimensional medical devices such as brain probes and cardiac stents to alleviate the foreign-body reactions resulting from the device implantation and prevent adverse effects caused by the drug burst release.

The vapor-based encapsulation bypassed the use of any solvent, which eliminated the burst drug release due to the solvent effect. The crosslinking structure in the encapsulation enabled the zero-order release of dexamethasone and the release rate was regulated by varying the dose density and encapsulation thickness to fulfill any dose needs in different therapies.

**Bio-adhesion control**

We are using Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) as the surface modification for the implanted medical devices to reduce the adhesion of biomolecules such as bacteria and blood cells, thus avoiding device-related infection and thrombosis in use.

The polymer coatings with hierarchical roughness were first fabricated and modified on the substrates of SW, SS, plastic, and glass by combining CVD steps with varying saturation ratios. The coating provides a superhydrophobic surface that significantly reduced blood and bacteria adhesion. On the surface of the hierarchically roughened coating surface, the bacteria adhesion was reduced by 79.75 %  and the blood coagulation decreased by 98.82 % compared with the smooth coating.
