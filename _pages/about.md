**Chegqian Huang** received his Bachelor in **Chemical Engineering** from Southeast University at 2017 and he is now a Ph.D. candidate in **Biosystems Engineering** at Oklahoma State University. 

Chengqian is available for:

* peer review for journals and conferences
* collaborate to write review papers
* (co-)guest editor for a special issue of journals

Research Interests
------

Chengqian Huang's research focuses on the design, characterization, and application of **polymer nanofilms** based on Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). He is devoted to manipulating the microstructures and compositions of CVD polymer films to achieve functional modifications of various membranes and medical devices for different environmental and biological applications such as wastewater treatments/purifications, pharmaceutics drug delivery, and bioadhesion control.

Projects
------
**Oily wastewater treatment**

We are using the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method to modify the metal meshes with special wettability and using the modified mesh for the treatment of oily wastewater coming from the industry or oil spill accidents. When the wastewater passed the modified mesh, the clean water will be separated and the petroleum oil will be recovered fastly and efficiently.

Compared with the traditional liquid-based modification, the CVD method preserved the mesh openings after modification, which allows the water freely penetrated to ensure fast wastewater treatment. The specially designed modification layer provides strong surface resistance to oil contaminations and improves the oil recovery efficiency for the mesh.
